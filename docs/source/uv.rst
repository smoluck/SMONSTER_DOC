Concept
-------
    
   The UV kit is available from the kit bar and can be accessed directly from the 3D viewport as well as from the UV viewport.
   
   It is designed to speedup the projection and unwrap of UV from a given mesh, using Coplanar selection presets.
   It also make sure UV islands are not flipped and repacked and normalize Texel Density at every steps. That way ensure a nice layout preview of your UV state.
   
   Principles of the main commands rely on selecting a one or set of polygons and let the selection presets do the rest of the coplanar selection for you.
